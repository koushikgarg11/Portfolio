2. Create and activate a virtual environment
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows PowerShell
   # or
   source .venv/bin/activate # macOS/Linux
   ```

3. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure environment variables
   ```bash
   copy .env.example .env
   ```
   Then add your API keys if you want to use cloud providers.

5. Run the app
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The service will start on:
